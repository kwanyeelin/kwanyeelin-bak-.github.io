Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

<!-- **About** -->

<!-- <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p> -->


I am the Director of R&D at IAG of SenseTime Group Inc., working with [Chen Qian](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AerkT0YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). I lead the development and research of 3D Perceiving R&D Centre, which serves for several leading automakers (e.g., BMW, Honda and NIO) and has delivered 20+ mass-produced projects in the intelligent cabin industry.

I was a post-doc researcher at [MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), with Prof. [Hongsheng li](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/) and [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). Previously, I received my PhD degree in the Department of Information Science, School of Mathematical Sciences at [Peking University](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/).

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics** and **XR**. I am particularly interested in 3d scene understanding, deep generative models, neural rendering and animation.
